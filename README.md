## Usage
There are a couple of different ways to use this package in your app:

- [Standalone bundle](#standalone-bundle) (**recommended**)
- [UMD bundle](#umd-bundle)
- [CommonJS](#commonjs) (`require()`)
- [CSS](#css)

### Standalone bundle
**This is the recommended import method.** To use the standalone bundle, add a
single script tag to your document after the one for `formio.js`, e.g.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/formiojs/dist/formio.full.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/formio-sfds/dist/formio-sfds.standalone.js"></script>
```

The standalone bundle does a bunch of things automatically:

1. Inlines the [CSS](#css) in the `<head>`
2. Calls `Formio.use(FormioSFDS)`
2. Patches `Formio.createForm()` so that any form created from then includes
   [SFDS-specific enhancements](#formiocreateform-improvements)

### CSS
The CSS in this package provides a suite of styles that target a mix of
Form.io-generated selectors, classes used in the custom theme templates, and a
suite of general-purpose utility classes for tweaking individual elements.

#### Scoped CSS
All of the selectors in the packaged CSS are scoped to (nested in) a
`.formio-sfds` class selector, which effectively prevents them from leaking
into the page where the form is embedded.

Unless you're using the [standalone bundle](#standalone-bundle) (which wraps
the form elements automatically), you'll need to wrap all of your the elements
targeted by `Formio.createForm()` with a `<div class="formio-sfds">`.

### UMD bundle
The UMD bundle exports **only** the Formio theme as `FormioSFDS`, and does not
automatically patch `Formio.createForm()`. This may be your best option if
you're working in an environment with multiple forms on a single page, and/or
other Form.io themes.

First, load both the `formiojs` and `formio-sfds` bundles from your CDN of
choice (e.g. [unpkg]) and link to the CSS:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/formiojs/dist/formio.full.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/formio-sfds/dist/formio-sfds.umd.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/formio-sfds/dist/formio-sfds.css">
```

Then, either in a deferred script or on window `load`, tell Form.io to "use" the SFDS theme:

```js
Formio.use(FormioSFDS)
```

You'll need to do this _before_ you call `Formio.createForm()` to ensure that the templates are registered before the form is built.

### CommonJS
If you're using a CommonJS bundler like webpack, browserify, et al:

1. Install both `formiojs` and `formio-sfds` npm packages:

   ```
   npm install formiojs formio-sfds
   ```

2. Import in your app:

    ```js
    const { Formio } = require('formiojs')
    const FormioSFDS = require('formio-sfds')

    Formio.use(FormioSFDS)
    ```

## Custom components

* `address` fields are rendered as multiple text and number inputs with address
  lines (1 and 2), city, state and zip code.

* Fields with type `state` render an HTML `<select>` input with the 50 U.S.
  states.

* Fields with type `zip` render a ZIP code input field that validates against a
  5-digit number or a ZIP+4 pattern (e.g. `94110-1234`).


## Form options
This theme provides support from additional options by [patching `Formio.createForm()`](#formiocreateform-improvements):

#### `data` option
If provided, the `data` option will be passed along as the form's initial
submission. See also: the [`prefill` option](#prefill-option).

#### `googleTranslate` option
If `googleTranslate` is `false`, the `notranslate` class is added to the
form element wrapper to prevent Google Translate from touching it. This is
preferable (but not required!) when translations are provided via the
`i18n` option, since Google Translate will attempt to translate any element
that _doesn't_ have the `notranslate` class, and may replace a human
translation with a machine translation.

#### `hooks` option
If the `hooks` option is an object, any value that isn't a function is
converted to a [declarative action](#declarative-actions). See formiojs's
[hooks documentation](https://github.com/formio/formio.js/wiki/Form-Renderer#hooks)
for the list of available hooks.

#### `i18n` option
If the `i18n` option is a string, it's treated as a JSON URL from which to
load localizations (translations of form content and field info).

#### `on` option
Like `hooks`, the `on` object can be used to specify [declarative
actions](#declarative-actions) for any of formiojs's
[known form events](https://github.com/formio/formio.js/wiki/Form-Renderer#events).

#### `prefill` option
The `prefill` option allows you to pre-fill form inputs with submission
data:

* The value `querystring` will cause pre-fill values to be parsed from
  `window.location.search`. E.g. `?foo=bar` will initialze the form
  submission as `{foo: 'bar'}`.

* The value `hash` will cause pre-fill values to be parsed from
  `window.location.hash` (afer the leading `#`), so `#foo=bar` will
  initialize the form submission as `{foo: 'bar'}`.

* Otherwise, if `prefill` is an instance of [URLSearchParams], the form
  submission will be initialized using its entries.

#### `formioSFDSOptOut` option
Setting the `formioSFDSOptOut` option to `true` disables all of the
following customizations for your form:

* Scoped style modifications. **Note:** template modifications can't be
  opted out because they're provided at the theme level, so you'll need to
  style the selectors generated by [this theme's template](src/templates),
  not the built-in ones!

* Select components will not be rendered as plain old `<select>` elements
  by default, and the `autocomplete` tag will be ignored.

* Custom [event handlers](#on-option) will not be registered.

* The [`prefill` option](#prefill-option) will be ignored.


## `Formio.createForm()` improvements

* Detects the form rendering language (locale) by looking for the closest
  element with a `lang` attribute.

* Select components are made to always use the `html5` "widget", which is just
  an HTML `<select>` input

* Form elements are wrapped automatically in `<div class="formio-sfds">`, which
  allows the element itself to receive styles defined in the [scoped CSS](#scoped-css).
  **This behavior can be disabled via the [`formioSFDSOptOut`
  option](#formiosfdsoptout-option).**

## Localization
Localization of form field labels and descriptions can be implemented without
having to keep form.io and the English equivalent in sync with string IDs in
the format `{key}_label` (for field labels) and `{key}_description` (for field
descriptions). For example, given this translation spreadsheet:

| String | en | es |
| :--- | :--- | :-- |
| `homeAddress_label` | Home address | DirecciÃ³n de casa |

...a field with an API key of `homeAddress` will get the spreadsheet
value, _regardless of the label's value in form.io_.

The same rule applies for HTML content components, which can be overridden
using the `{key}_content` string ID.

## Icons
SFDS icons are rendered with a [selector
observer](https://github.com/josh/selector-observer) to inject SVG icons into
any element with a `data-icon` attribute, as in:

```html
<span data-icon="next" aria-label="Next"></span>
```

See [the source](src/icons/index.js) for a full list of possible `data-icon`
attribute values.

## Declarative actions
The `hooks` and `on` options allow you to customize form behaviors using a
limited vocabulary of "declarative" actions. Each key of these objects is
the name of a hook or event, and its value is an object with a single key
that corresponds to one of the following actions:

* `redirect` takes either a URL string or an object with a `url` key and
  redirects (by setting `window.location`) to the URL. Submission data
  values may be interpolated in the redirect URL as `{key}`, where `key` is
  the API key of the form input. For example:

    ```json
    {
      "on": {
        "submit": {
          "redirect": "/confirm?username={username}"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

* `validateWithService` passes the submission data to an HTTP web service
  for validation. The `url` is the URL of the web service, and may contain
  form value interpolations (e.g. `{username}` expands to
  `form.submission.data.username`), `method` tells it the HTTP verb
  (default: `POST`), and `messages` is an optional object containing custom
  messages for different types of errors, such as
  `{empty: "error message if the response was empty"}`. For instance, you
  might wish to validate a username field via an external service that
  would respond with an error if the provided username is already taken:

    ```json
    {
      "hooks": {
        "beforeSubmit": {
          "validateWithService": {
            "url": "https://some-validation-service.example.com/username/{username}"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  If the web service fails, _or_ if it's successful and the response JSON
  has an `errors` or `error` key, those are reported as errors and will
  abort `beforeSubmit` hooks.

* `values` validates submissions by comparing the value of the submission
  data with each key in the `values` object. For instance, to ensure that
  the `foo` form input has a value of `"bar"` before submission:

    ```json
    {
      "hooks": {
        "beforeSubmit": {
          "values": {
            "foo": "bar"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
